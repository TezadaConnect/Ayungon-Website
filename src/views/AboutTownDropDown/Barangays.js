It has one sitio, Lo-ok, included in its territorial jurisdiction. The origin of calling this barrio dated back shortly after the Americans came. The place is located along the coast. It was famous for fish and other sea products. In the sea, just a hundred yards from the shore is a rock which comes out of the surface of the water during low tide. Schools of various kinds of fishes used to inhabit the bottom of the rock. People from different places care to fish in this place. During that time, the natives knew not of better way to catch fish then to poison them with the roots of locally grown plants known as “tubli”. This act of catching fish is commonly called “Tampok” in the local dialect. The fisherman went to “Tampok” the fish in this area. Usually they made a good catch so that the people in the neighboring barrios came to this place to barter their products with fish. These people named the place Tampocon, a name derived from the method they used to catch fish. Since that time, the place was named Tampocon which name continually exist until present.',

It comprises the sitios of Oyot, Cambuing, Lodgoron and Candagahay.The origin of calling this barrio dates back from the discovery of its notable spring which until now is giving water supply to the people in the whole barrio and nearby sitios. Long before the Americans came there was no formal organization of the barrio. When the Americans came they begun to construct roads along the coast. The place was covered with forest. They were overcome by the great difficulty due to scarcity of water in this vicinity. Because of the resourcefulness of Engineer Dingkin who was then in charge of the road construction he found he found the source of water after days of untiring effort under a palm tree which natives called Anibong. From that time on that place was called Anibong.',

It was so rocky and with steep cliffs. In the southern part was a river and a nigh mountain. At the western part is a mountain too covered with clouds every three o'clock in the afternoon Manogtong as a name of the place now was taken from a tree which is medicinal called 'Manogtong'. This was called such because during the olden days there was no water in this place and people around the barrio were craving for water. So, one time a heavy rain falls almost a week. During that time many springs came out from the big stones called 'talaptap'. An old man who was so weak brought with him a bamboo tube to get water from any place. Fortunately, he passed by a big tree where a spring came out like a real spring that would never lost its water. About a few days the old man came back bringing with him cooked food, pig, chicken, tuba and spread them over a banana leaf near the spring. This was called 'abang'",

It has a grassy plain about one and a half hectares where in the school is built. Actually, trees could be seen around, thus adding to the beauty of the spot.When or whom was it organized is uncertain. But according to the facts I gathered from the people, this place a long time ago was just merely a spot not very much known to the people. One of those inhabited the place was Gelano Impiel. He was the leader of the few Inhabitants. He thought of cutting down big trees and making it into kaingin. He planted corn and rice, vegetables coconuts and fruit trees. Soon the other inhabitants followed him. They made kaingin and planted the same crops that Galeno Impiel planted. It was not long after that the forest spot was converted to big corn fields and rice fields with fruit trees around. It yielded much and good crops. For many years the early people cultivated the same lot. At first it gave them a good harvest but as years rolled on, though big their fields were but the yield was very much less. This was because the soil was not fertile anymore. So, the people neglected it. Soon the cogon grass spread to grow all over, and so until now the place is wide grassy land. The descendant of Gelano Impiel multiplied a number and presently some of the people have inherited the blood of that early ancestor. However, the surname Impiel is totally ignored.',

When one of the lowlanders wished to buy corn, he would sat to his son “Go to Amboy Ducia and bus some corn”. When the son was asked by someone on the way where he was going he would say to Amboy Ducia or from Amboy Ducia if asked where he was from.

				'The present official and popular name of the barrio is Banban. As far as its history and origin is concerned, the name has not been changed ever since the time of the Spaniards when provinces, towns and barrios and sitios were first politically organized and even during the pre-Spanish period. Dating back to the time when the barangay was then the form of government the name was already known as Banban. But then it was yet a sitio in the midst of wilderness. The place was a hunting ground of fierce and wild animals. Even now wild animals such as deer, wild pigs and wild chickens are still abounding the area. The piece was seldom reached by civilized people except by brave hunters and men who used to gather rattan and other forest products. It was then largely a forestall region with some cogonal areas. The first people who inhabited the area were the Negritos who lived on hunting wild animals and wild roots as well as camotes, gabi, ube and other root crops they raised from their little clearing or “Kaingin”. These people gradually disappeared at the coming of the Spaniards. Yet until now there are still remnants of the race whom could be traced clearly as of the Negrito blood and characteristics.The barrio was originally derived from certain plant called “Banban” which is a good raw material for making baskets and the like. This plant abounded the whole area in the forests, amidst the hills and valleys and along the river banks. But the whole barrio is at present popularly named after the Banban river itself which is crossing the plains and valleys of the barrio some kilometers away from its source to Hilabangan River which flows down to Ilog River in Negros Occidental.Banban is approximately eighteen kilometers form then town of Ayungon, Negros Oriental. Hiking up and westward to the hinterland from the town, one can reach the place in five to six hours at a regular rate. The ways are passable by horses, carabaos and other animals as well as by men. No good roads through which trucks, automobiles, bicycles, and other vehicles may pass, ever connect from ayungon to Banban except the narrow trails.',

In this hill was a slope and in it lived the first inhabitant’s many years ago. This hill offered a beautiful vista. In the south the gloomy part of the Carol-an could be seen and in the north beautiful panorama of the Bontoc hill overlooking Hilabangan river and the vast plains of Kabangkalan, Negros Occidental could be seen too.

It is named after the river, but there is no enough reliable sources of information, why the river is named so. Among the many legends that I had gathered this might be nearly the origin.  Long - long time ago, families lived by clans. This place had been inhabited by many clans. Each clan had to fence their homes with the different kinds of sharp things to protect them from the sudden attacked of savage people. The savage people were called Magahats. Magahats were people who had incurred so much griefs on due to some distress in the family, especially death. The able-bodied men and women of the diseased would armed themselves, then roamed around the vicinity or go to neighboring places to kill other persons for revenge. Magahats during those days rambled along the river. In most cases one group of Magahats met another group as they met, they fought against one another. There were also instances that the Magahats were hunted by those who were not Magahats as they met, they too, fought against each other.',
