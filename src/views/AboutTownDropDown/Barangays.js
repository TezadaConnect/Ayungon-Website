At a distance he saw a monkey up in the tree. He got this bow and arrow and aimed it at the huge animal. Unfortunately, the arrow went another way not hitting the monkey. It tells into the pond and hit a big mud fish called “AWA”. The Negritos then, discovered that there were plenty of fish in the pond. Since that time the natives called this place AWA-AN from the fish called “AWA”. During the World War II, all houses were burnt by the USAFFE. No lives were lost. The products were commandeered by the soldiers. Lt. Kayanan has fled to this barrio. At present this place is famous because of the miraculous image',

It has one sitio, Lo-ok, included in its territorial jurisdiction. The origin of calling this barrio dated back shortly after the Americans came. The place is located along the coast. It was famous for fish and other sea products. In the sea, just a hundred yards from the shore is a rock which comes out of the surface of the water during low tide. Schools of various kinds of fishes used to inhabit the bottom of the rock. People from different places care to fish in this place. During that time, the natives knew not of better way to catch fish then to poison them with the roots of locally grown plants known as “tubli”. This act of catching fish is commonly called “Tampok” in the local dialect. The fisherman went to “Tampok” the fish in this area. Usually they made a good catch so that the people in the neighboring barrios came to this place to barter their products with fish. These people named the place Tampocon, a name derived from the method they used to catch fish. Since that time, the place was named Tampocon which name continually exist until present.',

				'A little more than three-kilometer driver from the town proper of Ayungon is the barrio of Anibong. It comprises the sitios of Oyot, Cambuing, Lodgoron and Candagahay.The origin of calling this barrio dates back from the discovery of its notable spring which until now is giving water supply to the people in the whole barrio and nearby sitios. Long before the Americans came there was no formal organization of the barrio. When the Americans came they begun to construct roads along the coast. The place was covered with forest. They were overcome by the great difficulty due to scarcity of water in this vicinity. Because of the resourcefulness of Engineer Dingkin who was then in charge of the road construction he found he found the source of water after days of untiring effort under a palm tree which natives called Anibong. From that time on that place was called Anibong.',

				"During the early days before the Spaniards came to this place there was a place secluded from the other barrios and was about five kilometers away From Calag Calag within the town of Ayungon, Negros Oriental. It was so rocky and with steep cliffs. In the southern part was a river and a nigh mountain. At the western part is a mountain too covered with clouds every three o'clock in the afternoon Manogtong as a name of the place now was taken from a tree which is medicinal called 'Manogtong'. This was called such because during the olden days there was no water in this place and people around the barrio were craving for water. So, one time a heavy rain falls almost a week. During that time many springs came out from the big stones called 'talaptap'. An old man who was so weak brought with him a bamboo tube to get water from any place. Fortunately, he passed by a big tree where a spring came out like a real spring that would never lost its water. About a few days the old man came back bringing with him cooked food, pig, chicken, tuba and spread them over a banana leaf near the spring. This was called 'abang'",

The sitios comprising the barrio are Kamandagan, Cabot, Amaga, Dalamo, Busay, Abong, and Libas. During the Spanish time, there were few families residing in the barrio, but because of the fertile lands which the barrio has, it has attracted many families to work in the fertile lands.

				'The present official name of the barrio comprises the sitios of Mansuso, Kutad, Gabon and Manhunoghunog is AMDOS. This is how the place got its name. A long time ago there lived this place a wealthy farmer whose name was Pablo. He was commonly called by the lowlanders and by the people in the neighborhood as Amboy Ducia due to the fact that his wife’s name was Teoducia. When one of the lowlanders wished to buy corn, he would sat to his son “Go to Amboy Ducia and bus some corn”. When the son was asked by someone on the way where he was going he would say to Amboy Ducia or from Amboy Ducia if asked where he was from. At last the place was called Amdos for short after the name of Amboy Ducia when he died.',

				'It is a slightly hilly place two and a half kilometers above the town of Ayungon. Its view could be seen of we stand along the road. It has a grassy plain about one and a half hectares where in the school is built. Actually, trees could be seen around, thus adding to the beauty of the spot.When or whom was it organized is uncertain. But according to the facts I gathered from the people, this place a long time ago was just merely a spot not very much known to the people. One of those inhabited the place was Gelano Impiel. He was the leader of the few Inhabitants. He thought of cutting down big trees and making it into kaingin. He planted corn and rice, vegetables coconuts and fruit trees. Soon the other inhabitants followed him. They made kaingin and planted the same crops that Galeno Impiel planted. It was not long after that the forest spot was converted to big corn fields and rice fields with fruit trees around. It yielded much and good crops. For many years the early people cultivated the same lot. At first it gave them a good harvest but as years rolled on, though big their fields were but the yield was very much less. This was because the soil was not fertile anymore. So, the people neglected it. Soon the cogon grass spread to grow all over, and so until now the place is wide grassy land. The descendant of Gelano Impiel multiplied a number and presently some of the people have inherited the blood of that early ancestor. However, the surname Impiel is totally ignored.',
